# Felipe Pozza Parpineli
<sub>*Python developer* and Data Science enthusiasth</sub>

As a Python developer and lawyer I can perfectly combine my knowledge in extremely different areas to find the best way to put my development and analysis skills into practice, solving difficult problems and situations.

In recent years I have been dedicated to finding intelligent ways to extract and manipulate data, including practical experience in the financial market.

I am a semester away from graduating in Systems Analysis and Development and I also have a Bachelor's Degree in Law and a Post-Graduate Degree in Civil Procedure, in addition to several courses.

**Background in:** Python, Data Science and Machine Learning.
